# ðŸŒŠ LiBuTS â€” Light-Budget Twin for Seagrass Restoration

## Overview
**LiBuTS** (*Light-Budget Twin for Seagrass Restoration*) is a physics-guided, explainable-AI modeling framework designed to evaluate seagrass habitat suitability and restoration potential under varying underwater light and turbidity conditions.  
The project integrates multi-source datasets â€” **Copernicus Marine (OLCI)** optical products, **NASA POWER** radiation data, and **GEBCO 2025** bathymetry â€” to create a harmonized digital twin of coastal ecosystems, starting with the **Greifswalder Bodden** in the southern Baltic Sea.

## Scientific Motivation
Seagrass meadows play a critical role in **blue carbon storage**, **biodiversity maintenance**, and **coastal resilience**, yet they are declining globally due to light limitation, eutrophication, and changing underwater lightscapes.  
Understanding and predicting how physicalâ€“biogeochemical and optical variables interact to support seagrass growth is essential for targeted restoration and climate mitigation. LiBuTS bridges this gap by coupling **physics-based euphotic depth modeling** with **machine learning explainability** and **multi-objective optimization**.

## Study Region
**Greifswalder Bodden**, a shallow lagoon in the southern Baltic Sea (Germany), represents an ecologically sensitive and restoration-priority area.  
LiBuTS leverages high-resolution bathymetry and OLCI water-quality data to assess the interplay between turbidity, depth, and photosynthetically active radiation (PAR).

## Key Outcome
LiBuTS delivers a reproducible framework and digital twin for:
- Mapping seagrass habitat suitability and light limitation;
- Estimating COâ‚‚ storage potential;
- Quantifying uncertainty;
- Prioritizing restoration zones through multi-objective optimization;
- Visualizing results via an interactive open-source dashboard.
